Holcan:
Perhaps Holcan could have a combat bonus and victory gold vs units of City States?
Basically Barbarossa's Ability plus gold on victory.

British Legion:
maybe they don't suffer combat damage loss when damaged and fighting on hills?
Samurai bonus but only on hills - I like it.
Bonus when attacking Ranged
